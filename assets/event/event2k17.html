                    <p> According to the famous saying of Mrs. Kirthiga Reddy, Head, Facebook india “i strongly believe
                        that the first step and the most important tool towards women empowerment is education. The
                        right education will ensure that women are more competent and confident in taking up bigger
                        challenges and raising the bar in any field”. To promote women in engineering, acm student
                        chapter, department of computer science and engineering organized a 24-hour national level
                        hackathon in collaboration with acm-w and oracle academy on 2nd -3rd oct, 2017 for girl
                        students.

                        3rd of october marked the end of the hackathon. This journey of the hackathon started with the
                        participation of 308 enthusiastic and tech-savvy teams from all over india with the theme of
                        digital india. A team of 52 highly professional members from acm india, chitkara university, and
                        oracle academy was formed to review the ideas and select the best 20 teams out of it. The
                        selected 20 teams were then promoted to the next round which was held on 9th september 2017.
                        After in-depth discussions with all the 20 teams, 10 teams were filtered were hence promoted to
                        the final round. The top 10 teams and one wild card entry accompanied by their respective
                        mentors were invited to chitkara university on 2nd october 2017 and were given 24 hours to
                        successfully run their application and showcase their idea to the judging panel. Dr. madhu
                        chitkra, honorable vice-chancellor of chitkara university also addressed the students and gave
                        prizes to the top three winners. Top three teams got 24000/, 15000/ and 12000/ respectively as a
                        prize money and were given chitkara university goodies.</p>

                    <p> ACM Student Chapter in association with Department of Computer science and Engineering organized
                        workshop on topic “Node.js” on 6th -7th September 2017 in Mooc Hall. The speaker of the occasion
                        was Dr. Rimpi Sharma from VCL infotech. She has 15 years of experience in the field of IT
                        Training and development sector. 70 Students participated in the workshop. The session was
                        highly knowledgeable. The session covers the concept of nodejs, javascript and database
                        connectivity for the web page. Session was highly interactive and appreciated by the
                        students.The Students who attended full workshop got their certificates too .

                        The students present in the workshop definitely gained some knowledge about nodejs and
                        javascript. ACM team with their coordination and hardwork made the event successful</p>

                    <p> ACM Student Chapter, Chitkara University, organised a half-day fun cum technical event
                        “Conjecture”, on 3rd August 2017 in Bernoulli Hall. A total of 35 teams, and 70 participants,
                        spread across the CSE Department from 2nd and 3rd year, took part in this workshop. First round,
                        named “Handy-Tech”, required a single member from each team to outline their right hand on a
                        sheet of paper within 1 minute, and within that outline including the maximum number of
                        technical words they could in a time-span of 2 minutes. Only 15 teams managed to surpass this
                        round. These results lead to the second round, named “Crypt-o-gizmo”, which involved solving
                        aptitude and logical reasoning questions, thrown in with gadget questions of which a tech junkie
                        would be proud of, made an excellent test of a team’s rationale thinking and knowledge. Only
                        five teams made it through to the final round, titled “Buzzzzzz…”.A buzzer round, it consisted
                        of 10 objective questions based on various disciplines of the computing world, which were
                        designed to test a team’s coordination, reflexes and knowledge in the aforementioned streams.

                        This intensely contested round gave us our winners Mr. Karan Nagpal, and Mr. Ketan Bansal from
                        CSE 3rd year and gave us our runner-ups Miss Ishani and Mr. Ishwinder from CSE 2nd year. The
                        winner were given trophies and certificates. This event served as a platform for every
                        participant to test themselves and their knowledge at an excellent level.</p>

                    <p> ACM Student Chapter, Chitkara University, in collaboration with ACM India and CSPathshala,
                        organized a one-day workshop on the topic Bringing Computational Thinking to School, on 15 July,
                        2017 at Chitkara International School, Sector-25,Chandigarh. The main goal of this workshop was
                        to impart pedagogical as well as content training to teachers.Interacting with 165 delegates in
                        the workshop was Ms. Sonia Garcha, CSpathshala Volunteer, Program Associate – CSR, Development
                        Support Team along-with guest speaker Mr. Madhavan Mukund, President of ACM India and Professor
                        and Dean of Studies, Chennai Mathematical Institute, Chennai. This workshop imparted training to
                        the teachers on problem solving and computational thinking, which enabled them to learn more
                        about topics such as, decomposition, patterns, abstraction, algorithms, analysis and programming
                        with day to day examples. Finally, at the end of the workshop, teachers received CS Curriculum
                        and Participation certificates.

                        The workshop served as a huge step towards fulfilling the ultimate goal of CSPathshala, i.e. to
                        impart computing as a science to every child in every school in India, as teachers are the one
                        of the most important building blocks towards the process of building a young ,Digital India.

                        participating teams to pick out a slip, which contained the topic on which they will be getting
                        coding questions on. Out of total 6 questions, the teams had to solve the maximum questions in
                        45 minutes.

                        The competition was tough and teams proved their “coding skills” with great zeal. First position
                        was bagged by Kartik Gandhi and Kashish Singal of CSE 2nd year and 2nd position was bagged by
