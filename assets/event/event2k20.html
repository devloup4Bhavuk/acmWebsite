                    <p>Chitkara ACM Student Chapter
                        On 29th December,2020, the Chitkara ACM Student Chapter organized a webinar on ” Unsupervised
                        Learning in Data Mining”. Dr. Debnath Bhattacharyya Ph.D (Tech. Computer Science and
                        Engineering) University of Calcutta, was the esteemed speaker and created an interactive session
                        on this exuberant topic. Mr. Debnath told many things about Data Mining and explained each
                        everything in a informative manner. What are the requirements of Clustering Algorithms,how to
                        measure the quality of clustering and more topics in the series.
                        Defining the day, we had 245+ students attending our webinar. The participants were filled with
                        excitement and gained valuable knowledge from the workshop. The event received tremendous
                        positive feedback.Chitkara ACM looks forward for such more amazing sessions in the future.</p>

                    <p>Chitkara ACM Student Chapter, in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science and
                        Engineering, organized “Hour of Code”, an innovative event on December 12, 2020, from 3:00 P.M
                        to 10:00 P.M, which emphasized relieving the week-long stress and work-load of students, with
                        fun-induced coding sessions rather than regular ones. Getting participation from nearly 61
                        students, the gathering was successfully handled by the department advisors and the members of
                        ACM. Games like Ozaria, a classroom-centered phylogeny of CodeCombat and one of the most
                        prevalent coding games in history, and Soccer-shots were arranged, which were well apprehended
                        by everyone.
                        Students actively reacted to the enigmas raised, as well as asked their doubts through the chat
                        option, which were taken up by specialists. Everyone was thrilled to play the games and learn
                        new ideas about coding au-courant. The top three performers were challenged to finish the game,
                        which provoked activity during the culmination of the session. The concourse ended with a vote
                        of thanks by the handling team. It was indeed an exhilarating, convivial, and enlightening
                        session.</p>

                        everyday was full of knowledge and interaction. Students got to know about the tricks they will

                        ‘Mental Health is not a destination but a process. It’s about how you drive, not where you are

                    <p>We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.
                        One of simplest way to gain satisfaction from life is by dedicating time to community service.
                        Chitkara ACM Student Chapter decided to aid those in the need of guidance and extra help. The
                        COVID-19 pandemic is impacting life in every part of our world and we are seeing, how critical
                        is to leverage ingenuity and strength at the local level. With our already existing networks, we
                        planned to respond to the needs of this rapidly developing situation. It is also important to
                        stay positive in these challenging time. We spread awareness and empower people about their role
                        in stopping the spread of the virus. Our team distributed clothes, hand sanitisers, masks,
                        soaps, demonstrated handwash techniques and necessary precautionary measures to many needy
                        people. This is a tough period and we have to act responsibly, taking care of our own safety and
                        of those around us.
                        This program impacted us in a positive manner and we discovered that serving others is an
                        enjoyable experience. Nothing else could match the glorious feeling we got from making a small
                        difference in the lives of these people. The combined efforts of ACM family made volunteer hours
                        a worthwhile experience.</p>

                    <p>thy speech be better than silence, or be silent.

                        When a chance is being given to us to speak, they say let the words flow from the heart, in
                        order to reach the hearts of the listeners, the words should come from the mind. So as to
                        enhance the skills of handling immense pressure and maintaining a pace of words, Chitkara ACM
                        Student Chapter organised Flip It for the first-year students. This event was a great success as
                        it came out to be the first interaction of the freshers with the college environment and
                        seniors. There were a series of quiz, whoever replied the fastest was given a topic and was
                        asked to flip the motion.
                        Everyone got an opportunity for showcasing their speaking skills and others got a wonderful
                        chance to learn something new.</p>

                        how to engineer it. By enhancing the capabilities and developing the skills, he mentioned how
                        the students will be introduced to newer technologies that will aid in building a robust
                        security infrastructure. He also brings to the table an interesting mix of perimeter security,
                        data security, integrated threat management and cyber security wisdom.
                        Overall it was an interactive session where along with theoretical aspects working paths were
                        also discussed which helped the attendants in understanding the network architecture in
