                        new backend development tool but their interest grew progressively as both the speakers started
                        connecting working of this technical backend tool with real life examples. After that,
                        participants showed persistent enthusiasm throughout the workshop.

                    <p>Web development is a key specialization in IT sector. Not only it’s interesting but also serves
                        as a major field in technology.<br>
                        So in order to develop a pre requisite knowledge for the upcoming developers, Chitkara

                        React js is an open source JavaScript library for building user interface. It can be used as a
                        base in the development of single page or mobile applications. So our society organized a 2 day
                        workshop where the experts from ‘Erginous solutions’ shared their experience and expertise with
                        the participants and helped them explore and build a fully functional project on full stack
                        JavaScript with react js. 73 students participated in the event. The event showcased the
                        combined efforts of the ACM family.</p>
