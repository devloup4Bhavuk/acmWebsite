                    <p>To brush up our coding skills and ignite our minds with advancement and enthusiasm, Chitkara ACM
                        Student Chapter in collaboration with Chitkara University Department of Computer Science and
                        Engineering and Coding Ninjas provided a window of opportunity through Codathon 2k21. The event
                        encompassed two rounds. The Preliminary round was conducted on 27th January on the CodeZen
                        platform. The round included 10 MCQs and 1 coding question. Out of 380 , 130 students were
                        fortunate enough to qualify the round with their proficiency and aptness. The Final round*was
                        conducted on 29th January in which 112 students participated and were challenged with 5 coding
                        questions on the CodeZen platform.<br><br>

                        Results are as follows:<br><br>

                        1. Deepak <br>
                        2. Shikhar Dhawan <br>
                        3. Adishi Sood <br><br>
                        It is rightly said, Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. It was indeed
                        a great event. We appreciate the efforts put in by the participants and would like to
                        congratulate all the winners for their well-deserved success</p>

                    <p>This year Department of Computer Science and Engineering is aiming at ICPC, so Chitkara ACM
                        Student Chapter in association with department of Computer Science and Engineering organized a
                        session on Connecting Competitive Programming, ICPC and Placements. The session was held online
                        on March 26 from 1:00pm onwards. <br>

                        The panel member was Deepak Gour who is an ICPC World Finalist 2020 graduated from IIT BHU. He
                        has worked with Samsung R&D, Tower Research, Directi, Flock, InterviewBit and AppDynamics. The
                        session covered all the ascepts of competitive programming, its benefits, what is ICPC and how
                        does all of this help in cracking the coding interviews. <br>

                        The event as a whole brushed upon a spectrum of exciting and interesting facts about competitive
                        programming.The session was a resounding success with 200 participants. It increased the
                        disruptive thinking and all the participants gained better understanding about the concept. The
                        session was an engaging and enriching experience for all the participants.</p>

                        Chitkara ACM Student Chapter in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science and
                        Engineering organized PRELUDE, an orientation session for B.Tech Software Engineering first-year
                        students. The orientation focused to expand the mind and soul of the students with the ocean of
                        benefits and advancement of the ACM Student Chapter. Our ACM student chapter happens to be
                        mentioned as an ‘Honorable chapter’ in Best Student Chapter Awards 2021. The organization has
                        further conducted endless hackathons, expert talks, and workshops. And most of all, the Chitkara
                        ACM student Chapter happens to have its own app.Students were given deep and extensive
                        information about the ACM Student Chapter.<br><br>


                        The orientation was held on 2nd April 2021 from 2 pm onwards.27 students were lucky enough to
                        grasp this golden opportunity and gather enough information about the most technical society of
                        the university.</p>

                        organized “Boost your competitive programming” coding competition with Codechef under the TRAIN
                        PRATICE PERFORM series of ICPC. The competition was conducted on April 25,2021. It was held to
                        recognize and reward the programming skills of students . It was an ideal platform to showcase
                        talent and to put coders on an accelerated path for preparation of ICPC.<br><br>

                        It featured few coding questions to be performed on Codechef platform. The judging criteria will
                        be based on overall score and time. A total of 107 students participated in the coding
                        competition out of which high scores were selected for further round of preparation classes to
                        be conducted by codechef team. This event was designed to stretch limits and challenges and
                        helped the participants to explore their latent talent and showcase programming skills. Each and
                        everyone who participated performed very well and showcased their talent. The event was a
                        smashing success due to efforts of entire ACM family.</p>

                    <p>Chitkara ACM Student Chapter, in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science and
                        Engineering and GitHub, organized “CodeWars 4.0” for neophytes and coding practitioners to
                        support the impression of discovering Coding languages and the pool of potentialities they
                        offer, on May 10, 2021, from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm.<br>

                        The competition consisted of an online questionnaire directed via CodeQuotient, which consisted
                        of 10 Multiple Choice Questions and 5 Coding Enigmas to be solved in 150 minutes.<br>

                        All the participants were justly delighted about working on the bonafide quandaries on Python
                        and Java language conferred before them. The coding problems posed legitimate issues and
                        dilemmas which were tackled adroitly.<br>

                        Receiving a rejoinder from approximately 223 students, the concourse was successfully overlooked
                        for any inquiries by the faculty advisor Mr. Sarvjeet Singh and Student Heads. <br><br>

                        Top three positions were grabbed by:<br><br>

                        Ist position- Varun Kansal<br>

                        2nd position – Jagrit Vats<br>

                        All the participants performed really well. It was indeed invigorating and an illuminating
                        examination that stimulated curiosity about programming in several participants.</p>
