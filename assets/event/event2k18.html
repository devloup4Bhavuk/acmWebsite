                ACM , IEI and IEEE organized a coding competition under the University Fest ‘EXPLORE’.  32 teams took part in the first round of the competition while 25 teams were present during the second round. During this event students got the idea of how to get into coding competitions. These kinds of events are meant to make the students analyze and ideate in carrying out various projects in association with respective industries.They were given freedom of choice of their own programming language.
                The first round was a pen paper quiz which had questions from all languages. The second round was a coding competition, in which only one member could code at a time and the partners were switched periodically.

The test consisted of a plethora of questions, which not only gave an opportunity to every applicant to test their proficiency in C and C++, but also enabled them to test their mental strength.<br><br>
