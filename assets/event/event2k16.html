                    <h4>Chitkara ACM Student Chapter, in collaboration with the Department of Computer Science and
                        Engineering,
                        organized “Hour of Code”, an innovative event on December 12, 2020, from 3:00 P.M to 10:00 P.M,
                        which
                        emphasized relieving the week-long stress and work-load of students, with fun-induced coding
                        sessions rather
                        than regular ones. Getting participation from nearly 61 students, the gathering was successfully
                        handled by
                        the department advisors and the members of ACM. Games like Ozaria, a classroom-centered
                        phylogeny of
                        CodeCombat and one of the most prevalent coding games in history, and Soccer-shots were
                        arranged, which were
                        well apprehended by everyone.
                        Students actively reacted to the enigmas raised, as well as asked their doubts through the chat
                        option,
                        which were taken up by specialists. Everyone was thrilled to play the games and learn new ideas
                        about coding
                        au-courant. The top three performers were challenged to finish the game, which provoked activity
                        during the
                        culmination of the session. The concourse ended with a vote of thanks by the handling team. It
                        was indeed an
                        exhilarating, convivial, and enlightening session.</h4>
