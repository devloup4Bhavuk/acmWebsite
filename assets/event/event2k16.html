                        Students enjoyed the session and enhance their skills with great enthusiasm. Approximately 30
                        students participated in the workshop. Overall it was a great experience for all the
                        participants.</p>

                    <p>ACM Student Chapter organised a full day workshop on Android app Development using ionic on 14th
                        September, 2016 in Faraday Hall. Hybrid apps are a blend, hence the name hybrid, of both native
                        and web solutions. Hybrid apps are popular because they allow developers to write code for a
                        mobile app once and still accommodate multiple platforms.Hybrid apps are developed using HTML,
                        CSS and Javascript, and then wrapped in a native applications. All students participated with
                        great zeal and enthusiasm . An interactive decorum was maintained in the hall. It was quite
                        surprising to see such complicated topics like ionic, Angular JS to be simplified to an extent
                        that everybody could learn them easily. Chief speaker of the workshop was Mr. Tejinder Singh,
                        technical head of 9i Technologies. Apart from teaching these topics he also encouraged students
                        to opt for online courses. 46 students participated in the workshop.<br>
                        Students showed an enthusiastic approach towards the event. They were keen to ask a lot of
                        questions related to career, technical skills, professional growth, and many more. The talk made
                        students explore a part of parallel computing, helping them both academically and
                        professionally.</p>

                    <p>ACM Student Chapter, in collaboration with ACM India and CSPathshala, organized a one-day
                        workshop on the topic Bringing Computational Thinking to School, on 15 July, 2016 at Chitkara
                        International School, Sector-25,Chandigarh.<br><br>


                        The main goal of this workshop was to impart pedagogical as well as content training to
                        teachers.Interacting with 165 delegates in the workshop was Ms. Sonia Garcha, CSpathshala
                        Volunteer, Program Associate – CSR, Development Support Team along-with guest speaker Mr.
                        Madhavan Mukund, President of ACM India and Professor and Dean of Studies, Chennai Mathematical
                        Institute, Chennai. This workshop imparted training to the teachers on problem solving and
                        computational thinking, which enabled them to learn more about topics such as, decomposition,
                        patterns, abstraction, algorithms, analysis and programming with day to day examples.Finally, at
                        the end of the workshop, teachers received CS Curriculum and Participation certificates. The
                        workshop served as a huge step towards fulfilling the ultimate goal of CSPathshala, i.e. to
                        impart computing as a science to every child in every school in India, as teachers are the one
                        of the most important building blocks towards the process of building a young ,Digital India.
