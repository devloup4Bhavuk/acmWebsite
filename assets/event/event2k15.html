                    <p>ACM student chapter organised a workshop on Ethical Hacking ,”Hack X Ploit” on 3-4th
                        November,2015. Around 200 students were trained by Mr.Rahul Tyagi, AVP Luciedus Techonologies
                        and India’s topmost hacker. In this workshop students acknowledged a complete knowledge of basic
                        networking and ethical hacking.This workshop aimed at giving students a basic knowledge of
                        hacking and how they could protect one’s system against hazardous effects. Hacking has been a
                        part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad discipline, which covers a wide
                        range of topics. The workshop was an enriching experience for the students and they were amazed
                        to see the scope and practical implications of Hacking in our day to day life. At the end of the
                        workshop certificates were provided to the students.Top two students were selected for the next
                        level of workshop. Students showed keen interest in attending more advanced workshops like this
                        in future.</p>

                    <p>ACM Student Chapter organized industrial visit to Semi Conductor Laboratory, Mohali on 30th
                        September 2015. Only 2 of our students (Rajat Sharma and Shubham Singla) got a chance to visit
                        the site. In the first section, they went to Class 1 Zone, where they were shown how the
                        fabrication of a wafor takes place which gave them the idea about the initial step for an IC
                        production and how the base layer deposition, electrical layer deposition and sacrificial
                        removal process takes place. In the second section students were taken to the R&D Department.
                        Here they came to know about various techniques to design an IC through VHDL. Next they were
                        taken to de-ionised water plant where they were the process to de-ionise the water and to bring
                        down the resistivity of the water. Lastly they were taken to class 100 they were shown the
                        packaging process of an IC by soldering or by manual installment of a wafor the package.
                        The head of department also told them how they planned to upgrade the fab after IBM backed out
                        the deal and how SCL was undergoing an upgrade to produce chips of 0.18 micrometers from tower
                        semiconductor, Israel. The students interacted with the officials and gained a lot of knowledge
                        which will be useful for them in their academic.</p>

                    <p>ACM Student Chapter organized CS Coach, a Programming Workshop for second year students of
                        Department of Computer Science and Engineering on 25th July, 2015. Mr. Iqbal Singh, Sr R&D
                        Engineer, Synopses conducted the hands-on session on C Programming from the viewpoint of
                        programming competitions taking place all over the globe and especially ACM ICPC. The expert
                        introduced the need of logic building in engineering students and motivated them to explore
                        their potential to compete with country’s leading programmers who take part in National and
                        International level Hackathon. 130 enthusiastic students and programming geeks participated in
                        the workshop. The workshop is a part of a series of events that will be organized twice a month
                        for the shortlisted participants to boost their zeal to program and excel in the field of
                        Computer Science. All the students really appreciated the contents that were discussed, they
                        realized that interactions likes these can help them improve their skills.</p>

                        book programming challenge on 15th March, 2015. Code pirates saw more than 192 young innovators
                        from various countries hack their way through intense competition . Participants were allowed to
                        work on multiple tracks and challenges in parallel, although they needed to indicate which
                        challenges they applied for. Top three positions were held by

                        1. Adam Richardson (Canada)
                        2. kmcode (Japan)
                        3. Bhavesh Munot (India)

                        The highest purpose of the organisation is to attract the best developers worldwide. It was also
                        an excellent opportunity to get in contact with highly motivated developers and to establish
                        network with likeminded people and discuss ambitious ideas outside daily work environment.</p>

                        with industrial insights and experiences of their own. The session inspired students to open
                        forum and understand the industrial challenges and how to deal with them, which shall be useful
                        for them in their professional careers.
                        Students showed an enthusiastic approach towards the event. They were keen to ask a lot of
                        questions related to career, technical skills, professional growth, and many more. The talk made

                        to compete online. The initiative to practise programmings skills of the buddying engineers at
                        Chitkara University touched the sky with 193 developers from India, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore,
                        Ukraine, and Gulf participated in the challenge. Detail of winners are

                    <p>The ground realities of India and its CS higher education pose unique challenges. For the past
                        year and half, an effort has been on to develop a model curriculum focused on a few sample
                        courses. Towards this end, the current workshop focuses on a hands on approach towards an
                        ACM-IEEE CS2015 style curriculum development that is relevant to the Indian context.

                        The first session of the workshop was conducted by Mr.Madhavan Mukund (Dean of Studies and a
                        professor of Computer Science at Chennai Mathematical Institute) .He is also the President and
                        Member of Indian Association for Research in Computing Science and the President of Association
                        for Computing Machinery India Council.The second session was delivered by Abhijat Vichare
                        (fellow at the Persistent Computing Institute, Persistent Systems Ltd.). He has worked in the
                        GCC system internals at IIT Bombay, and has been a faculty at the CS Department, University of
                        Pune. These initial efforts have developed the basic framework and noted a number of potential
                        pitfalls in this adaptation process. The key next step is to involve our academia into the
                        process.</p>
