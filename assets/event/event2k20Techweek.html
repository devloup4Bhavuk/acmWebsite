                        development. Mr. Vrijraj Singh helped to enlighten the students on the subject and gave a talk
                        on the vast possibilities and career opportunities with web development. This helped the
                        students to have a much clear understanding of why they should pursue web development & how.

                        After the end of his talk, he held a thrilling Q&A session for about 30 mins, in which
                        participants showed much eagerness and asked a lot of important questions. The response of the
                        audience was amazing and we received over 400 registrations for the same, while more than 250+

                    <p>CHITKARA ACM Student Chapter Successfully conducted another workshop under TECHWEEK 2020 on 22nd

                        Automation or RPA. Robotic process automation is a form of business process automation
                        technology based on metaphorical software robots(bots) or on artificial intelligence (AI)
                        workers. In the workshop Mr. Vivek Bhardwaj, a certified RPA professional and trainer spoke
                        about what is RPA, how does it work, how does it prepare you for the industries. He taught
                        automation of 2 bots through automation anywhere. He in the workshop, helped attendees make bots
                        themselves. 2 hours of such an interactive session is a success itself. There is no value
                        available to the exposure that these workshops give you about the future of industries. RPA is
                        one of the most in-demand and highly paid skills in today’s world and we provided certificates
                        to all participants. With the help of all participants and combined efforts of the complete ACM
                        team, the event was an interactive one. The response has been beyond expectations…</p>

                        and skill development through a series of example giving a glass clear explanation to all
                        attendants of the event. He emphatically stressed on the need of learning and acquiring the
                        command over emerging languages. Students were also inquisitive to know the scope and
